!username,

A request to reset the password for your account has been made at !site.

You may now log in to !uri_brief by clicking on this link or copying and pasting it in your browser:

This is a one-time login, so it can be used only once. It expires after one day and nothing will happen if it's not used.

After logging in, you will be redirected to !edit_uri so you can change your password.
