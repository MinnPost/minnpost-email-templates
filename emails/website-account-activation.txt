!username,

Your account at !site has been activated.

You may now log in by clicking on this link or copying and pasting it in your browser:

!login_url

This is a one-time login, so it can be used only once.

After logging in, you will be redirected to !edit_uri so you can change your password.

Once you have set your own password, you will be able to log in to !login_uri in the future using:

username: !username
